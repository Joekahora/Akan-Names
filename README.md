# PROJECT-NAME
AKAN NAME
# DESCRIPTION
The Akan Name is based on the Ghananian Naming System where Children Are named after
the day they were born so if a boy is born on Sunday then his name will be Kwasi and
if a girl is born on Sunday then her Name will be Akosua. So the WebApp requires the 
user to input the date he/she was born then the month and then the year. Upon clicking
the submit button it will call a javascript function to do the calculation to find out 
the exact date you were born.
